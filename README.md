This mod introduces Troops (Teams) that players can join to team up as they race to the PEAK. Will you beat the other troops <br>
through climbing prowess, or resort to sabotage to be the fastest up the PEAK.

## Features
- Troops. Race as a team or alone in 1 of 12 troops.
- Armbands. Rep your troop with this extra bit of swag.
- Climb Timer. Track your progress up to the PEAK.
- Leaderboard. See how you stack up compared to the other troops.

## Notes
Things to be aware of while using this mod:
- Your individual timer will stop once you make it to the campfire and wait for the other players to make it up.
- Team scores are the average time of all members of your troop.
- Dying increases your timer by 5 minutes, but doesnt stop the ticking until the user is respawned at the campfire.
- The respawn statues will no longer respawn players, and always default to giving an item.
- All dead players will respawn at the campfire once all climbers have died or made it to the top.

This mod can be used standalone, but I intended for it to be played using:
[PEAK Unlimited](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/glarmer/PEAK_Unlimited/) 

This mod is also in active development, feel free to reach out to me if you encounter bugs, issues, or would like to help with development.
